🧠 AI Multi-Disease Predictor
A modern web application that predicts multiple diseases based on user inputs like age, gender, and symptoms using a simulated AI model.


📋 Features
🎯 Predicts diseases based on symptoms
📈 Shows prediction with confidence level
⚡ Fast, responsive design
🎨 Built with HTML, TailwindCSS, and Vanilla JS

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (TailwindCSS), JavaScript
Design: TailwindCSS, Google Fonts (Inter)

🧠 How It Works
User enters their Age, Symptoms (comma-separated), and Gender.
On submitting the form:
A random disease is predicted from a predefined list.
A random confidence percentage (between 60%-99%) is assigned.
Results are displayed dynamically on the webpage.

🔮 Future Plans
🔗 Connect to Real Machine Learning Model:
Replace the simulated random prediction with a real ML model trained on disease diagnosis datasets.
🖥️ Backend Integration:
Build a lightweight backend using Flask, FastAPI, or Node.js to handle real predictions and data processing.
🌐 Deployment:
Deploy the full-stack application to platforms like Render, Vercel, or AWS for public access.
🧠 Improved Prediction Logic:
Fine-tune disease prediction based on specific symptoms entered by users, possibly using NLP techniques.
